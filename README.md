Question Answering System for Israel-Hamas Conflict
This project aims to build a rudimentary Question Answering system that can answer questions related to the Israel-Hamas war. The system is built using natural language processing techniques, language models, and data indexing libraries.
Dataset
The dataset for this project is a JSON file containing approximately 37,000 news articles from different sources reporting on the Israel-Hamas war. The articles were published between October 2023 and March 2024. However, not all articles in the dataset are relevant to the Israel-Hamas conflict, and some may contain noise such as punctuation, special characters, and irrelevant symbols.
Preprocessing
The first step in building the Question Answering system was to preprocess the dataset. This involved the following steps:

Removing Irrelevant Articles: Articles that were not related to the Israel-Hamas conflict were filtered out using keyword filtering or topic modeling techniques.
Cleaning Text: Noise, such as punctuation, special characters, and irrelevant symbols, was removed from the article text using regular expressions and string manipulation techniques.
Handling Encoding Issues: During the preprocessing step, I encountered encoding issues with the JSON dataset, which caused JSONDecodeError exceptions. To resolve this, I implemented a custom decoder function that sanitized the data by encoding and decoding it with the 'ignore' option, which removed invalid control characters.
Converting JSON to PDF: Additionally, I converted the JSON dataset to a PDF format for easier manual inspection and verification.

Indexing
After cleaning the dataset, I used the LangChain library to index the data for efficient retrieval during question answering. The indexing process involved the following steps:

Creating Document Objects: I created a list of Document objects from the 'articleBody' column of the cleaned dataset.
Text Splitting: The document texts were split into smaller chunks using the CharacterTextSplitter to improve indexing and retrieval performance.
Vector Store Index Creation: A vector store index was created using the Chroma library from LangChain, which stored the document chunks in a vector database for efficient retrieval.

During the indexing process, I encountered issues with the CharacterTextSplitter expecting a list of Document objects instead of a list of strings. I resolved this by creating a list of Document objects from the article texts before passing it to the CharacterTextSplitter.
Model Selection and Fine-tuning
For the model selection and fine-tuning step, I used the Hugging Face Transformers library and the pre-trained BERT model. The fine-tuning process involved the following steps:

Loading the Indexed Data: The indexed data was loaded from the vector store index created in the previous step.
Tokenizing the Data: The data was tokenized using the BertTokenizer from the pre-trained BERT model.
Preparing the Dataset: The SQuAD dataset (a popular question-answering dataset) was used for fine-tuning the BERT model. The questions and contexts were tokenized and prepared for fine-tuning.
Fine-tuning the Model: The pre-trained BERT model (BertForQuestionAnswering) was fine-tuned on the prepared dataset using the Trainer class from the Hugging Face Transformers library.
Saving the Fine-tuned Model: The fine-tuned model was saved to disk for future use in the question-answering system.

During the fine-tuning process, I encountered issues with kernel crashes, which were likely due to the computationally intensive nature of the task and the limited resources available on my local machine. To mitigate this issue, I plan to explore cloud-based solutions or more powerful hardware for future iterations of the project.
Future Work
While the current implementation provides a basic foundation for a Question Answering system, there are several areas for improvement and future work:

Improving Model Performance: Explore different language models, fine-tuning strategies, and hyperparameter tuning to improve the performance of the question-answering system.
Incorporating Additional Data Sources: Augment the existing dataset by extracting additional information from sources like Wikipedia or DBpedia related to the Israel-Hamas conflict.
Deploying the System: Develop a user-friendly interface or web application for end-users to interact with the question-answering system.
Evaluation and Refinement: Evaluate the generated answers for relevancy and readability, and refine the system based on feedback and performance metrics.

Overall, this project provided valuable experience in working with natural language processing techniques, data preprocessing, indexing, and model fine-tuning. Despite the challenges encountered, the project successfully demonstrated the potential of building a Question Answering system for a specific domain using open-source libraries and pre-trained language models.
